-- | A generic socket type. Also see `socket` for details.
--
--   The socket is just an `Control.Concurrent.MVar.MVar`-wrapped file descriptor.
--   It is exposed in order to make this library easily extensible, but it is
--   usually not necessary nor advised to work directly on the file descriptor.
--   If you do, the following rules must be obeyed:
--
--   - Make sure not to deadlock. Use `Control.Concurrent.MVar.withMVar` or similar.
--   - The lock __must not__ be held during a blocking call. This would make it impossible
--     to send and receive simultaneously or to close the socket.
--   - The lock __must__ be held when calling operations that use the file descriptor.
--     Otherwise the socket might get closed or even reused by another
--     thread/capability which might result in reading from or writing
--     totally different connection. This is a security nightmare!
--   - The socket is non-blocking and all the code relies on that assumption.
--     You need to use GHC's eventing mechanism primitives to block until
--     something happens. The former rules forbid to use `GHC.Conc.threadWaitRead` as it
--     does not seperate between registering the file descriptor (for which
--     the lock __must__ be held) and the actual waiting (for which you must
--     __not__ hold the lock).
--     Also see [this](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2014-September/115823.html)
--     thread and read the library code to see how the problem is currently circumvented.
